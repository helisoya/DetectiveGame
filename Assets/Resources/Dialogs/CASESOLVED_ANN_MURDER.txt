FocusCamera(Player)
Dialog(Arthur;I have a theory about what happened.;Player;false)

FocusCamera(Daniel)
Dialog(Daniel;Already ? Man ! You are really cut to be a detective.;Daniel;false)
Dialog(Daniel;So, you figured out everything ? Who did it ?;Daniel;false)

FocusCamera(Player)
Dialog(Arthur;Patience, brother. I don't know who did it, not yet.;Player;false)
Dialog(Arthur;What I can conclude from my investigation, is that the culprit is definitly human.;Player;false)

FocusCamera(Daniel)
Dialog(Daniel;Really ? How did you know ?;Daniel;false)

FocusCamera(Player)
Dialog(Arthur;Well, let's review what we know.;Player;false)

ShowCG(ANNMURDER_1;5)
Dialog(Arthur;Mother was in her room. Knowing her, she was probably knitting.;Player;false)
Dialog(Arthur;Unbeknown to her, she wasn't alone. Someone was here to kill her.;Player;false)

ShowCG(ANNMURDER_2;5)
Dialog(Arthur;Given the marks on her body. I can almost be certain that she fought with her murderer.;Player;false)

ShowCG(ANNMURDER_3;5)
Dialog(Arthur;While she couldn't fend off her attacker in the end, she still managed to rip off a piece of clothing from them.;Player;false)

ShowCG(ANNMURDER_4;5)
Dialog(Arthur;She was then killed, and lightly burned in the process. The killer could have used a candlestick for that.;Player;false)

ShowCG(ANNMURDER_5;5)
Dialog(Arthur;The murderer then painted the mark on the wall and left.;Player;false)

ShowCG(ANNMURDER_6;5)
Dialog(Arthur;Nobody knew this happened. Esther was the first to find the body.;Player;false)
Dialog(Arthur;It was hours after the deeds, the killer had since been long gone.;Player;false)
Dialog(Arthur;She saw Mother, dead, as well as the mark on the wall.;Player;false)
Dialog(Arthur;She then told everyone, including Father, what she saw.;Player;false)

ShowCG(ANNMURDER_7;5)
Dialog(Arthur;Father deduced that the mark was genuine, and that the witch killed her.;Player;false)
Dialog(Arthur;However, he didn't seem to notice the purple torn piece of clothing.;Player;false)

HideCG(5)
Dialog(Arthur;This sums up about all the facts of the case.;Player;false)
Dialog(Arthur;Now, to my conclusion : The witch couldn't have done it.;Player;false)
Dialog(Arthur;We know that the witch supposedly is very powerful and malevolant. Often dismembering her victims.;Player;false)
Dialog(Arthur;But here is where we have our problem : Mother fought with her murderer.;Player;false)

FocusCamera(Daniel)
Dialog(Daniel;Right. But how is it relevant ?;Daniel;false)

FocusCamera(Player)
Dialog(Arthur;Hear me out. If you are a powerful witch, capable of killing someone in seconds.;Player;false)
Dialog(Arthur;Why would you only burn lightly your victim ? And why would you fight with her ?;Player;false)
Dialog(Arthur;If the witch really did it. She would have killed Mother instantly.;Player;false)

FocusCamera(Daniel)
Dialog(Daniel;Oh, right.;Daniel;false)

FocusCamera(Player)
Dialog(Arthur;And don't forget the piece of clothing. Would the witch be that clumsy ?;Player;false)
Dialog(Arthur;This is why I believe that the culprit is human.;Player;false)

FocusCamera(Daniel)
Dialog(Daniel;But how do you explain the mark, then ?;Daniel;false)

FocusCamera(Player)
Dialog(Arthur;Simple. The mark is a decoy. The culprit painted it on the wall after killing Mother.;Player;false)
Dialog(Arthur;They knew that if they did that, Father would blame the witch.;Player;false)

FocusCamera(Daniel)
Dialog(Daniel;And he wouldn't investigate further ! I see...;Daniel;false)

FocusCamera(Player)
Dialog(Arthur;Right. So, in my opinion, the culprit is likely someone who knows Father well.;Player;false)
Dialog(Arthur;They would also need to be able to access this room unnoticed.;Player;false)

FocusCamera(Daniel)
Dialog(Daniel;Wait, so you mean... One of the domestics did it ?;Daniel;false)

FocusCamera(Player)
Dialog(Arthur;Probably. I'm not sure. But it's more likely than saying a witch did it.;Player;false)
Dialog(Arthur;Well. I believe that we are finished here. We have to think about what we are going to do next.;Player;false)

FocusCamera(Daniel)
Dialog(Daniel;Right, we'll need to investigate the domestics. I can't believe one of them is a murderer.;Daniel;false)
Dialog(Daniel;But let's get out of here first. We stayed in here for too long. People might get suspicious.;Daniel;false)

FocusCamera(Player)
Dialog(Arthur;Right, let's go.;Player;true)
